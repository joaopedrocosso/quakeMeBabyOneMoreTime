# Readme for the front-end/back-end application

Make sure you have installed Docker or Docker Desktop in your machine.

In a terminal navigate to the root of the project and run the following command:


```bash
docker compose up
```

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000
And the backend will be available at http://localhost:8000

# Readme for the Machine Learning steps
## Required Libraries for Notebook Execution are listed in the requirements.txt file:
- We used: pandas, numpy, obspy, tensorflow, keras, scikit-learn

## Folder Structure of the Machine Learning Tab
- example_data: Contains an example of a csv and mseed that we used. For the total data used in model training, we concatenated all the csv/mseed files from the "Training" folder, generating a table of about 17-19GB, which could not be directly uploaded.
- model: Contains the best model generated by our neural network built with the Keras library, used in all notebooks that have any evaluation code.
- test_datasets_output_catalog: This folder contains the data catalogs required by the challenge. The description of all fields used can be found in the file [neural_network_evaluate.ipynb](https://github.com/joaopedrocosso/quakeMeBabyOneMoreTime/blob/main/machine-learning/neural_network_evaluate.ipynb).
- utils: Folder for extracting mathematical features used to complement all data already provided by NASA. These data are fed into the model during its training.

## Created Notebooks:
- In the notebook [Lunar_test_data_extraction](https://github.com/joaopedrocosso/quakeMeBabyOneMoreTime/blob/main/machine-learning/Lunar_test_data_extraction.ipynb), we extract data from the lunar/test folder.
- In the notebook [Lunar_train_data_extraction](https://github.com/joaopedrocosso/quakeMeBabyOneMoreTime/blob/main/machine-learning/Lunar_train_data_extraction.ipynb), we extract data from the lunar/train folder.
- In the notebook [Mars_test_data_extraction](https://github.com/joaopedrocosso/quakeMeBabyOneMoreTime/blob/main/machine-learning/Lunar_test_data_extraction.ipynb), we extract data from the mars/test folder.
- In the notebook [Mars_train_data_extraction](https://github.com/joaopedrocosso/quakeMeBabyOneMoreTime/blob/main/machine-learning/Lunar_train_data_extraction.ipynb), we extract data from the mars/train folder.
- In the notebook [api_function](https://github.com/joaopedrocosso/quakeMeBabyOneMoreTime/blob/main/machine-learning/api_function.ipynb), we have a function used on our website, allowing users to make custom predictions from a csv file and a sampling_rate value.
- In the notebook [neural_network_evaluate](https://github.com/joaopedrocosso/quakeMeBabyOneMoreTime/blob/main/machine-learning/neural_network_evaluate.ipynb), we evaluate our neural network, where the output catalogs are generated using the data obtained from the [Lunar_test_data_extraction](https://github.com/joaopedrocosso/quakeMeBabyOneMoreTime/blob/main/machine-learning/Lunar_test_data_extraction.ipynb) and [Mars_test_data_extraction](https://github.com/joaopedrocosso/quakeMeBabyOneMoreTime/blob/main/machine-learning/Lunar_test_data_extraction.ipynb) notebooks.
- In the notebook [neural_network_training](https://github.com/joaopedrocosso/quakeMeBabyOneMoreTime/blob/main/machine-learning/neural_network_training.ipynb), we load the training data created from the [Lunar_train_data_extraction](https://github.com/joaopedrocosso/quakeMeBabyOneMoreTime/blob/main/machine-learning/Lunar_train_data_extraction.ipynb) and [Mars_train_data_extraction](https://github.com/joaopedrocosso/quakeMeBabyOneMoreTime/blob/main/machine-learning/Lunar_train_data_extraction.ipynb) notebooks, along with the creation of our neural network and its evaluation.
